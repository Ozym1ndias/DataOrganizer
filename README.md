# DataOrganizer
DataOrganizer is a tool that organizes data, specifically phone numbers data. It takes as input a .txt file with raw phone numbers with or without the + sign, it then removes the + sign if it exists, adds , to the end of the phone number and skips to the next line and repeats with the next phone number.

+DataOrganizer.py adds the + sign if it does not exist in front of the phone number. DataOrganizer.py doesn't.
